## üö® Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. Apple App Store Compliance Violations
- **Issue**: Internal admin dashboard violates Apple Developer Subscription terms
- **Impact**: App will be rejected from App Store
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: Open
- **Solution**: Remove admin dashboard and create external data management system
- **Timeline**: Immediate (before any App Store submission)

### 2. Hard-coded Data Implementation
- **Issue**: Business data is hard-coded instead of dynamic
- **Impact**: Cannot update content without code changes
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: Open
- **Solution**: Replace with API-driven data from external admin system
- **Timeline**: Immediate (before any App Store submission)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority Supabase Performance Issues

### 1. RLS Policy Auth Function Re-evaluation (Critical Performance Impact)
- **Issue**: `auth.uid()` and `current_setting()` calls re-evaluated per row in RLS policies
- **Schema/Table**: `public.businesses`
- **Policies Affected**: 
  - "Staff can view all businesses"
  - "Moderators can update businesses" 
  - "Moderators can delete businesses"
- **Severity**: High
- **Root Cause**: Function calls in policy expressions executed for each row, causing high CPU usage
- **Impact**: Poor query performance at scale, potential database blocking
- **Recommended Fix**:
  ```sql
  -- Replace auth.uid() with scalar subquery
  -- BEFORE (problematic):
  USING (auth.uid() = some_column)
  
  -- AFTER (optimized):
  USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = some_column)
  
  -- For current_setting():
  -- BEFORE:
  USING (current_setting('jwt.claims.tenant_id') = some_value)
  
  -- AFTER:
  USING ((SELECT current_setting('jwt.claims.tenant_id')) = some_value)
  ```
- **Validation**: Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on representative queries; confirm reduced per-row function calls
- **Owner**: DB Team
- **Timeline**: Immediate

### 2. Multiple Permissive RLS Policies (Performance Degradation)
- **Issue**: Multiple permissive policies for same role/action combinations
- **Schema/Table**: `public.businesses`
- **Affected Combinations**:
  - `anon` + `INSERT`: "Allow public insert access", "Allow public insert access to businesses"
  - `anon` + `SELECT`: "Allow public read approved businesses", "Public can view approved businesses", "Staff can view all businesses"
  - `authenticated` + `DELETE`: "Allow authenticated users full access", "Moderators can delete businesses"
  - `authenticated` + `INSERT`: "Allow authenticated users full access", "Allow public insert access", "Allow public insert access to businesses"
  - `authenticated` + `SELECT`: "Allow authenticated users full access", "Allow public read approved businesses", "Public can view approved businesses", "Staff can view all businesses"
  - `authenticated` + `UPDATE`: "Allow authenticated users full access", "Moderators can update businesses"
  - `authenticator` + `INSERT`: "Allow public insert access", "Allow public insert access to businesses"
  - `authenticator` + `SELECT`: "Allow public read approved businesses", "Public can view approved businesses", "Staff can view all businesses"
  - `dashboard_user` + `INSERT`: "Allow public insert access", "Allow public insert access to businesses"
  - `dashboard_user` + `SELECT`: "Allow public read approved businesses", "Public can view approved businesses", "Staff can view all businesses"
- **Severity**: High
- **Root Cause**: Each permissive policy must be executed for every relevant query
- **Impact**: Suboptimal performance as multiple policies evaluated per query
- **Recommended Fix**:
  ```sql
  -- Consolidate policies by role and action
  -- Example for anon SELECT:
  DROP POLICY "Allow public read approved businesses" ON businesses;
  DROP POLICY "Public can view approved businesses" ON businesses;
  DROP POLICY "Staff can view all businesses" ON businesses;
  
  -- Create single consolidated policy
  CREATE POLICY "anon_select_businesses"
    ON businesses
    FOR SELECT
    TO anon
    USING (status = 'approved');
  ```
- **Validation**: Confirm single policy per role/action combination
- **Owner**: DB Team
- **Timeline**: Immediate

### 3. Missing Indexes on Policy/Filter Columns
- **Issue**: Queries and RLS policies filter on columns that are not indexed
- **Schema/Table**: `public.businesses`
- **Likely Columns**: `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `user_id` (if exists)
- **Severity**: High
- **Root Cause**: No index present on frequently filtered columns
- **Impact**: Sequential scans instead of index scans, poor query performance
- **Recommended Fix**:
  ```sql
  -- Create indexes on commonly filtered columns
  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_businesses_status ON businesses(status);
  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_businesses_created_at ON businesses(created_at);
  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_businesses_updated_at ON businesses(updated_at);
  
  -- For multi-column filters, consider composite indexes
  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_businesses_status_created_at 
    ON businesses(status, created_at);
  ```
- **Validation**: Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on representative queries; confirm index usage and reduced cost
- **Owner**: DB Team
- **Timeline**: Immediate

## üîß Medium Priority Issues

### 4. RLS Policy Misconfigurations
- **Problem**: Tables with RLS enabled block access unexpectedly (returns no rows)
- **Cause**: Missing or overly restrictive policies, or policies granted to the wrong role
- **Impact**: Users cannot access data they should be able to see
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Mitigation**: Use explicit policies per operation, test as anon/authenticated/staff, use helper functions for complex checks, and index columns used in policies

### 5. Overly Broad Policies (Service Role Leaks)
- **Problem**: Service keys hardcoded or used in client-side code give full DB access to attackers
- **Cause**: Using SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in client apps or exposing it in repos
- **Impact**: Complete database compromise if exposed
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Mitigation**: Never expose service keys publicly; use Edge Functions or server-side code with service keys; use anon keys in clients

### 6. Realtime Scaling and postgres_changes Pitfalls
- **Problem**: postgres_changes-based realtime subscriptions don't scale and can block the DB
- **Cause**: postgres_changes is single-threaded and not intended for high-volume apps
- **Impact**: Performance degradation and potential database blocking
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Mitigation**: Use realtime.broadcast (with DB triggers) and private channels; follow channel/topic naming and RLS on realtime.messages

### 7. Authentication / JWT Claim Mismatches
- **Problem**: auth.uid() returns NULL or custom claims aren't present in DB session
- **Cause**: Missing Authorization header, misconfigured JWT, or custom claims not mapped correctly
- **Impact**: Authentication failures and access control issues
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Mitigation**: Ensure client sets auth header, verify JWT via jwt.io, refresh tokens, and use auth.jwt() for custom claims. Test functions that rely on auth.uid()

### 8. Storage Object Access Problems
- **Problem**: Users can't access files despite correct bucket rules
- **Cause**: Wrong RLS policies on storage.objects, incorrect folder naming assumptions, or missing signed URLs
- **Impact**: Images and files not loading for users
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Mitigation**: Use correct storage.objects policies (see example patterns), verify foldername(name) semantics, and generate signed URLs where appropriate

### 9. Indexing and Performance Regressions
- **Problem**: Slow queries after adding RLS or complex policies
- **Cause**: Missing indexes on columns referenced in policies or WHERE clauses; policies forcing sequential scans
- **Impact**: Poor user experience due to slow loading
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Mitigation**: Add indexes on policy/filter columns (user_id, tenant_id, status), avoid unnecessary JOINs in policy expressions (use helper functions or subqueries), and EXPLAIN ANALYZE queries

### 10. Edge Function Deployment/Runtime Issues
- **Problem**: Functions fail in hosted environment but work locally
- **Cause**: Missing environment variables, version mismatches, or using unsupported third-party imports
- **Impact**: Broken functionality in production
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Mitigation**: Use SUPABASE_* env vars provided automatically, prefer Web APIs/Deno core, use npm: specifier with versions, and test with the same runtime as production

### 11. Admin Dashboard & CLI Permission Constraints
- **Problem**: Some operations fail due to organization-level settings or missing permissions
- **Cause**: Organization privacy/opt-in settings block debug tools (e.g., assistant tools), or user account lacks project permissions
- **Impact**: Cannot perform administrative tasks
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Mitigation**: Check organization settings and role permissions; perform actions with a user who has project owner privileges

### 12. Supabase Realtime Private Channel Authorization Problems
- **Problem**: Clients cannot subscribe to private channels or receive broadcasts
- **Cause**: RLS policies on realtime.messages/authorization mismatch; private channels require proper session/auth setup
- **Impact**: Real-time features not working
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Mitigation**: Ensure policies on realtime.messages allow SELECT/INSERT for authenticated users and that channels are created with private: true and the client sets auth before subscribing

### 13. Migration / Schema Drift and Extension Issues
- **Problem**: Migrations fail or extensions unavailable across environments
- **Cause**: Using extensions not installed in target DB, or migration order issues
- **Impact**: Deployment failures and inconsistent environments
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Mitigation**: Ensure required extensions are listed and installed (check pg_extension), run migrations in correct order, and test migrations in CI/staging

### 14. Rate Limits & Quota Surprises
- **Problem**: Unexpected rate limiting or project usage caps affecting behavior
- **Cause**: Hitting API or storage limits for a plan
- **Impact**: Service interruptions and degraded functionality
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Mitigation**: Monitor usage in dashboard, implement client-side rate limiting, and upgrade plan if needed

## üîß Low Priority Issues (Nice to Fix)

### 1. Environment Configuration
- **Issue**: Missing `.env.example` file
- **Impact**: New developers may struggle with setup
- **Priority**: Low
- **Status**: Open
- **Solution**: Create `.env.example` with placeholder values

### 2. Error Handling
- **Issue**: Limited error boundary coverage
- **Impact**: Potential unhandled errors in production
- **Priority**: Low
- **Status**: Open
- **Solution**: Add try-catch blocks around async operations and improve error logging

### 3. Type Safety
- **Issue**: Some `any` types in TypeScript
- **Impact**: Reduced type safety and potential runtime errors
- **Priority**: Low
- **Status**: Open
- **Solution**: Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

### 4. Debug Logging
- **Issue**: Debug console.log statements in production code
- **Location**: `src/components/DirectoryPage.tsx:401`
- **Impact**: Console clutter in production
- **Priority**: Low
- **Status**: Open
- **Solution**: Remove or wrap in development-only conditions

### 5. Legal Document Placeholders
- **Issue**: Privacy Policy and Terms of Service contain placeholder content
- **Location**: `src/components/PrivacyPolicyPage.tsx` and `src/components/TermsOfServicePage.tsx`
- **Impact**: Legal documents need to be customized for specific use case
- **Priority**: Low
- **Status**: Open
- **Solution**: Review and customize legal content, update "Last Updated" dates as needed
- **Note**: These files are easily editable and can be updated at any time
